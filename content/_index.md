# Veritas - Britevue API for verified reviews

Veritas allows consumers to earn rewards for reviewing businesses they patronize by tying their proof of purchase back to the review to give other consumers confidence the reviews they are reading are from real patrons.

To utilize the API, Veritas breaks down the process into:
1. [Receipts](receipts/)
1. [Reviews](reviews/)
1. [Rewards](rewards/)
